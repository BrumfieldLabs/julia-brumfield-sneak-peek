<p>Julia Ann Craddock Brumfield kept a diary from 1915 until 1936.  Some time after her death, those diaries were distributed among her many grandchildren.  Over the last twenty years, nearly half of those diaries have been reassembled to be shared among Julia's descendants.  The project is actively seeking other copies of these diaries.</p>

<p>Scanning of the diaries has been performed by Mark Trenchard and Ben Brumfield.  Transcription has been by many volunteers, especially including Linda Tucker and Neil Brumfield.  Editing has been performed by Ben Brumfield.</p>
