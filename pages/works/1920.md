<p>A clear cold day. Ben went to Chatham for Jim. They got home at dark. They come by Letcher Craddocks and got some honey. Josie washed some. We eat a cold dinner except coffee. I kept the baby. I do the work that has to be done or keep the baby from before light until after dark. I am afraid that I can't hold out at it until spring.
